A bridge for exchanging messages between IRC and Zulip, powered by
[the Zulip Matrix integration](/integrations/doc/matrix).

{!install-matrix.md!}

{!configure-matrix-bridge.md!}

Your Zulip notifications may look like:

Your IRC notifications may look like:

**Note**: There are certain
[IRC channels](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/wiki/Channels-from-which-the-IRC-bridge-is-banned)
where the Matrix.org IRC bridge has been banned for technical reasons.
You can't mirror those IRC channels using this integration.
