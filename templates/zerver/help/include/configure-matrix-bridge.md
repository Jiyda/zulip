### Configure the bridge

1. {!create-stream.md!}

1. On your {{ settings_html|safe }}, create a **Generic** bot for
   {{ integration_display_name }}. Subscribe this bot to the stream
   created in step 1.

1. Open `zulip/integrations/matrix/matrix_bridge_config.py` with your
   favorite editor, and change the following lines in the `zulip`
   section:

    ```
    "zulip": {
        "email": "matrix-bot@chat.zulip.org",
        "api_key": "your_key",
        "site": "https://chat.zulip.org",
        "stream": "Stream which acts as the bridge",
        "topic": "Topic of the stream"
    }
    ```

    **email**, **api_key**, and **site** should come from your
    {{ integration_display_name }} bot's `zuliprc` file. Set **stream**
    to the name of the stream created in step 1, and set **topic** to
    a topic of your choice.

1. Create a user on [matrix.org](https://matrix.org/), preferably
   with a descriptive name such as `zulip-bot`.

1. Open `matrix_bridge_config.py`, and provide your Matrix credentials
   in the `matrix` section:

    ```
    "matrix": {
        "host": "https://matrix.org",
        "username": "username of matrix.org user",
        "password": "password of matrix.org user",
        "room_id": "#room:matrix.org"
    }
    ```

    {% if 'IRC' in integration_display_name %}

    Matrix has been bridged to several popular
    [IRC Networks](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/wiki/Bridged-IRC-networks).
    **Room alias format** refers to the `room_id` for the corresponding IRC channel.
    For instance, for the freenode channel `#zulip-test`, the `room_id` would be
    `#freenode_#zulip-test:matrix.org`.

    {% endif %}

1. Run `python matrix_bridge.py` to start mirroring content.

!!! tip ""

    If you want to customize the message formatting, you can do so by
    editing the variables `MATRIX_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE` and `ZULIP_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE`
    in `zulip/integrations/matrix/matrix_bridge.py`.

**Congratulations! You have created the bridge successfully!**
